# Facial Expression Recognition

Group members: Zheng Wang, Tianchen Shen, Jason Li

## Setup

In this project, we are trying to apply machine learning and neural networks to recognize facial expressions. The task is to classify images of faces based on the emotions they have. We categorize facial expressions into anger, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad and surprise.  We also have a real-time detection and classification, using a webcam to capture an image, and feed it into the trained neural network.

## Data

The dataset we use is found on kaggle website, https://www.kaggle.com/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset.

## Techniques

We applied machine learning in this classification task as well as try different structures of neural networks to compare the results, including simple neural network, convolution neural network and transfer learning. We also tried varying the model parameters for learning rate, weight decay, functions, etc. for optimistic results.

## Description

We implemented facialDataSet to gather data from the dataset on kaggle website.
